Hello World.  My name is Adam Schaal, a Senior Software Security Engineer in Omaha, Nebraska.  I started as a developer for seven years with work ranging from data layer to presentation layer.  Over the past 4 years, I have been taking night classes in order to get my Master's degree in Cyber Security completing it in December 2016 and started in InfoSec in 2017.

During that timeframe I worked very hard to improve my cyber security skills.  I joined the university hacking team, competed in cyber Capture-the-Flag competitions, even passed the OSCP on my first attempt with 29 cracked lab boxes and 4 cracked exam boxes.  I helped organize a High School CTF event with hundreds of students and was even elected Vice President of the university hacking team.

Currently, I am signed up for the OSCE exam, participating in bug bounties, and challenging myself everyday.  I think that the most fun part of information security is the constant learning required to keep up with the industry.  On hatsec.io, I will try to track and mark my progress as I grow as an cyber security engineer.
